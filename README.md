# README.md Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

Using the inquirer package to prompt a series of questions from the user to generate a README.md file.

That README.md file will have a Title, and sections for Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

The user will be asked for a Title, a Description (this will use the editor open for longer answers), how to Install, how to Use the project, how someone can Contribute to the project and where to ask Questions via github and email.

There is a list to choose from to select a license that will generate a badge and url to link to the license information.

Once all of the prompts have been answered a generated-README.md will be written with fs.

I have, in fact, written this README.md with my own project!
